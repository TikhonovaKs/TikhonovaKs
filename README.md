## About me
In 2021, I started my IT journey as a tester but gradually got captivated by the IT world. Testing is about finding flaws in software, while programming is about building things. In 2023, I decided that creating is more important for me, completing a successful 10-month online course from Yandex, guided by experienced programmers.

***My current goal is*** âš¡
* to improve my technical skills
* to gain teamwork experience
* to get hands-on practice in the fall of 2024
